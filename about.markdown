I'm a software engineer and tech blogger. I believe that technology is the most revolutionary force for good in our world. Everyday technological progress advances and human knowledge expands, empowering us to find new innovative solutions to age-old challenges. The accelerating nature of this progress leads me to believe that we are currently living in an era that could rival the significance of the Industrial Revolution. It is my passion to document this period of exponential progress and play my part in educating others about the transformative technologies driving this change. I'm a graduate of Holberton School where I specialized in blockchain technology, systems programming, and advanced algorithms. In my spare time I enjoy cooking, creating generative art, and studying Brazilian jiu-jitsu.
