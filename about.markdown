I'm a software engineer and tech blogger. I believe that technology is the most revolutionary force for good in our world. Everyday technological progress advances and human knowledge expands, empowering us to find new innovative solutions to age-old challenges. I want to document the journey. 

Some of the subjects I write about include programming, blockchain technology, Web3, crypto, cybersecurity, privacy issues, and technopolitics. I'm a graduate of Holberton School where I specialized in low level programming and blockchain technology. In my spare time I enjoy cooking and creating generative art.
