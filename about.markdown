My name is Gunnar Bachelor. I’m a software engineer and technical writer. I believe that we are living through a pivotal time in world history. Technological development is changing established patterns of human life in a way unprecedented throughout our existence. Innovations and possibilities once confined to science fiction are now making regular appearances in headlines all over the globe, reshaping how we live, work, and interact, challenging our adaptability in this ever-shifting landscape. I want to document the journey.

Our fate is still undecided. Decisions made in our lifetimes will determine whether we harness technological innovation to create a safer, more sustainable, equitable world, or destroy ourselves through neglect and short-sightedness. It is my aim to bring clarity and insight to the intricate complexities of our digital era. This blog will serve as a chronicle of these transformative times – a mix of analysis, personal experience, and a glimpse into what the future might hold. Here, I will share my thoughts, explorations, and discoveries at the intersection of technology and humanity, hoping to engage in meaningful conversations with like-minded individuals who are just as passionate about shaping our collective future. Join me in this exciting journey as we navigate the uncharted waters of our technological age, understanding its challenges and celebrating its triumphs.
