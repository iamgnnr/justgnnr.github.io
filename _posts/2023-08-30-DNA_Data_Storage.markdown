DNA data storage is a cutting-edge approach which utilizes the information storage capacity of DNA molecules. Digital data, such as text, images, and files, can be encoded into the four nucleotide bases of DNA: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). These bases are analogous to the 0s and 1s of binary code. Due to the inherent density and stability of DNA, immense amounts of data can be stored within minuscule volumes for extended periods, potentially thousands of years. Researchers have made significant strides in developing methods for encoding, synthesizing, and decoding data from DNA, paving the way for a future where DNA could serve as a long-term, high-density storage medium that addresses the limitations of traditional digital storage technologies. This is a brief video about inventors Robert N. Grass & Wendelin Stark and their work to radically improve DNA data storage. Enjoy.
