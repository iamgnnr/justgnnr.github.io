While our bodies are miracles of biological evolution, equipped to survive and pass genetic information over millennia, they remain susceptible to disease, aging, and numerous physical and mental limitations. Technology is gradually making it possible to exceed these primordial restraints on our existence. From cutting-edge prosthetics that enhance mobility and aid those with disabilities, to regenerative medicine and gene editing that offer the potential to treat and prevent diseases, technology is poised to transform the way we relate our bodies. As we embrace these technological innovations, we embark on a journey to redefine what it means to be human, ultimately unlocking the door to a new era of physical and mental enhancement. Here's a summary of some of the ways that technological development and scientific discovery is improving human biology.

# 1. Brain-Computer Interfaces

A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a revolutionary technology that establishes a direct communication channel between the human brain and an external device, typically a computer or another electronic system. It enables the bidirectional exchange of information, allowing the brain to send commands to the computer and receive feedback or information from the computer without requiring any muscular or peripheral involvement.

Brain-computer interfaces have the potential to significantly impact various fields, including medicine, assistive technology, virtual reality, and more. [BCIs hold promise for assisting individuals with motor impairments, such as paralysis, allowing them to regain communication and mobility.](https://www.inverse.com/health/brain-computer-interface-helped-paralyzed-man-walk-again) [Additionally, BCIs can be used for advanced gaming experiences, enhancing human-computer interaction, and enabling new ways of interfacing with technology that go beyond traditional input methods like keyboards or touchscreens](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/12/16/brain-computer-gaming/).

Synchron is the first company to enter clinical trials in the US. BCI's of the past relied on neurosurgeons to cut open the skull for implantation, Synchron's strategy depends on a device called a "strenode". It functions similarly to a stent and is able to enter the brain through blood vessels in the neck. [The technology has already enabled patients with locked in syndrome to communicate via the power of thought](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/03/22/1047664/locked-in-patient-bci-communicate-in-sentences/#:~:text=In%20recent%20years,%20BCIs%20have,BCI%20to%20communicate%20full%20sentences).


The mission of Synchron is to be able to access any part of the brain with this technology opening up potential treatments for victims of ALS, spinal cord injuries, muscular dystrophy, brain damage, and many other debilitating illnesses. Tom Oxley, founder of Synchron, has speculated that eventually the technology will have applications beyond the field of medicine, perhaps eventually even enabling direct mind-to-mind communication. [Some preliminary work has already been done in this domain.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4138179/)

# 3. Vaccine Development

[Research for the Covid-19 vaccine has had the effect of accelerating the pace of vaccine research by decades](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/23/magazine/golden-age-medicine-biomedical-innovation.html). In recent years, there have been exciting advancements in vaccine technology, extending beyond traditional infectious disease vaccines to tackle complex health challenges like cancer, dementia, and heart disease. Significant progress has been achieved in the field of cancer research, [where researchers have developed therapeutic vaccines that effectively stimulate the immune system to identify and target cancer cells selectively](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/apr/07/cancer-and-heart-disease-vaccines-ready-by-end-of-the-decade). These vaccines hold immense promise for treating specific types of cancers and preventing their recurrence. 

[Similarly, efforts are being made to develop vaccines for heart disease that target specific risk factors like high cholesterol or inflammation, reducing the likelihood of cardiovascular events](https://hsci.harvard.edu/news/vaccination-prevent-heart-attacks). [Earlier this year, researchers at Juntendo University in Japan were able to reduce inflammation and improve other biomarkers in mice with dementia-like brain disorders.](https://gizmodo.com/japan-experimental-alzheimers-vaccine-is-promising-1850700985) These discoveries represent groundbreaking advancements in medical science that could potentially offer hope in managing and preventing these devastating conditions in the near future.

# 4. Anti-Aging Research

Over the past few years, anti-aging research has also witnessed remarkable progress, presenting hopeful approaches to address the effects of aging and extend lifespan. Scientists have made significant strides in understanding the underlying mechanisms of aging at the cellular and molecular levels. This knowledge has led to the development of several novel interventions currently being tested in animal trials.

## Heterochronic parabiosis 

Heterochronic parabiosis is an experimental procedure used in mice to investigate the potential for life extension. In this process, two mice of different ages are surgically joined, allowing them to share a circulatory system. The idea behind this method is that the younger mouse's blood contains compounds that promote tissue repair, cellular rejuvenation, and improved organ function. By being exposed to these beneficial factors in the shared bloodstream, the older mouse may experience a reversal of certain age-related decline, potentially extending lifespan. [Studies using heterochronic parabiosis have shown promising results](https://www.lifespan.io/news/heterochronic-parabiosis-extends-the-lives-of-mice/), indicating that it might hold the key to unlocking new insights into the aging process and the development of therapies for age-related diseases in humans. 

## Telomerase Gene Therapy

Telomerase gene therapy is a cutting-edge approach aimed at addressing cellular aging and age-related diseases. Telomeres are protective caps at the ends of chromosomes that naturally shorten with each cell division, eventually leading to cellular senescence and limited replicative capacity. Telomerase is an enzyme that can lengthen telomeres, potentially allowing cells to divide more extensively without undergoing senescence. In telomerase gene therapy, the telomerase gene is introduced into the target cells, providing them with the ability to produce telomerase and potentially extend their lifespan. [This therapy holds great promise in combating age-related conditions and regenerative medicine, as it may slow down cellular aging and improve tissue function.](https://proto.life/2023/08/gene-therapies-for-eternal-youth/)

## Senolytic Drugs

Senolytic drugs are medications that target and eliminate senescent cells, which are aging cells that have lost their ability to divide and contribute to age-related diseases and conditions. Chemical anti-aging treatments have lagged behind progress made in gene therapy. However, in recent months, much progress has been made to reverse this trend. [Harvard researchers, led by life extension expert David Sinclair, confirmed that they had reversed aging in mice by using a series of "chemical cocktails" to battle aging hallmarks in senescent cells.](https://fortune.com/well/2023/07/18/harvard-scientists-chemical-cocktail-may-reverse-aging-process-in-one-week/) Sinclair argues that this represents a turning point, and that in the future one might be able to reverse aging with a pill.

In another victory for chemical anti-aging treatments, [Integrated Biosciences, a biotech company that specializes in aging research, used machine learning models to discover new chemical compounds that may be able to revolutionize senolytic drugs](https://www.theweek.in/news/health/2023/07/08/ai-revolutionises-ageing-research--promising-anti-aging-compound.html). By utilizing known examples of senolytic and non-senolytic compounds, the researchers trained machine learning models to effectively distinguish between the two types and predict the senolytic potential of previously untrained molecules. After rigorous analysis, the team discovered 21 potential drug candidates, among which periplocin, ginkgetin, and oleandrin demonstrated exceptional abilities to eliminate senescent cells without causing harm to healthy cells.
