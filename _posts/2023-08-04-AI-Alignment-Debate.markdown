Yesterday George Hotz and Connor Leahy debated AI alignment and its accompanying issues of liberty, government regulation, fake news, control over the means of production, and other techno-political issues. It was the best discussion on the topic I’ve heard since ChatGPT took over the headlines. Personally, I believe that Hotz is correct on the issue of regulation, but I was disappointed by his overly simplistic libertarian reasons for defending a low regulation approach. (He might have been defending a no regulation approach?) I don’t take the science fiction scenarios painted by mainstream media seriously. (I don’t anticipate [becoming the pet of some super AI](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/25/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-says-humans-will-be-robots-pets).) I think it’s much more likely that governments and few powerful corporations could seize control of artificial intelligence resources and use it to maintain their power. This is an outcome that must be prevented at all costs. Decentralized research and open source software (like [Llama2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/)) will be the key. I do not think that Ayn Rand, capitalism, or [his strange argument for moving to Somalia](https://www.youtube.com/live/8LxTWIaInok?feature=share&t=1309) make a compelling case. Nevertheless, it was an entertaining discussion with both Hotz and Leahy acting out of a mutual respect for each other’s opinions— a rare occurrence in our increasingly divided political atmosphere. Enjoy.
