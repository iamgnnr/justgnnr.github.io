Metaculus, a forecasting enterprise, has established a worldwide community dedicated to analytical reasoning with the aim of tackling some of the most significant and complex questions facing the globe. In response to the question: When will an AI first pass a long, informed, adversarial Turing test? [the median consensus forecast pointed to the year 2028.](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/11861/when-will-ai-pass-a-difficult-turing-test/) This result prompted me to gather predictions from top figures in the artificial intelligence sector to see how their views align.
